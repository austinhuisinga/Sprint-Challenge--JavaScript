1. Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.
  
  .forEach does not return a new array, and must iterate throughout the entire array without stopping. 
  .map returns a new array, and doens't manipulate the original array. 

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  A method is simply a function on an object. 

3. What is closure?

  The combination of a function and the lexical environment in which it was created. 

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

  1. "this" will encompass everything when deployed in the global scope.

  2. when a function is called, "this" refers to the object left of the ".".

  3. when used in conjunction with a constructor, "this" refers to the constructed object.

  4. when using ".call" or ".apply", "this" is explicitly defined.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

  It's how the child class inherits properties from the parent class.
